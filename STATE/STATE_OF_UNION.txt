----- STATE/CHANGELOG.md (head 200) -----
- 2025-12-15T18:42:20Z: Initialized ENVIRONMENT.md & INVENTORY.yaml from /home/jodonnell/chloe/DIAG/reports/selective_2025-12-15T18:39:06Z.txt.

- 2025-12-17T08:04:04Z [obs/meet/firefox]: RHEL 10 Wayland+PipeWire: Firefox may not enumerate OBS v4l2loopback virtual camera in Google Meet. Fix: about:config media.webrtc.camera.allow-pipewire=false; restart Firefox; re-allow camera permission for meet.google.com. Verify /dev/video10 name and OBS holds it via fuser.
- 2025-12-17T08:14:28Z [cuda]: CUDA toolkit confirmed installed (cuda-toolkit-13-0 RPMs; /usr/local/cuda-13.0; nvcc V13.0.88). Updated state detection and PATH.
- 2025-12-17T08:18:17Z [fix]: Fixed update_state.sh stray 'BASH' delimiter line; ensured CUDA PATH via /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh; ensured chloe_mail helper in ~/.bashrc; ran update_state.sh.
- 2025-12-22T03:05:01Z [cuda/insights]: Removed global LD_LIBRARY_PATH from /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh; added /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf + ldconfig. cuda.sh now sets PATH only (prefers /usr/local/cuda/bin).

----- STATE/MAILBOX.md (tail 200) -----
# MAILBOX (curated)

## Active
- Clean up repo: commit remaining modified files + decide what to do with untracked scripts.
- Fix docs/index.html contamination reliably via a small script (no long pastes).
- Build Stream Deck “Kind Meeting Launch” script: browser → OBS → start virtual cam.

## Notes
- Raw session dumps are stored under STATE/JOURNAL/.
