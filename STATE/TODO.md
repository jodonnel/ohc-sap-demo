# TODO (short list)

## Now
- [ ] Decide what to do with tracked backup scripts in SCRIPTS/ (keep, move to RECOVERY/, or ignore/remove).
- [ ] Fix docs/index.html contamination reliably (deterministic regeneration; no long pastes).
- [ ] Build Stream Deck “Kind Meeting Launch” script: browser → OBS → start virtual cam.

## Soon
- [ ] Build and smoke-test llama.cpp with cuBLAS; record tokens/s in a new STATE/MODELS.md.
- [ ] Optional: enable NVIDIA container toolkit for Podman; validate a vLLM container on Driver 590.44.01 / CUDA 13.1.
