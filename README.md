# Open Hybrid Cloud Demo for SAP

A **live, replayable Open Hybrid Cloud (OHC) demonstration** focused on SAP workloads and event-driven architectures on Red Hat OpenShift.

Designed for **in-room, human-facing demos** where real actions at the edge are immediately visible on an enterprise platform.

## What this demo shows

Real events generated by people or devices at the **edge** flow through a lightweight **southbound interface**, are processed on **Red Hat OpenShift**, and become immediately visible to **IT / decision-support systems**.

Once this boundary works, everything north of it becomes a **design choice**, not a leap of faith.

## Architecture

[View the animated architecture diagram](https://jodonnel.github.io/ohc-sap-demo/architecture.html)

- **Event-driven** (SSE push, no polling)
- **Observable and auditable**
- **Reproducible** across clusters via kustomize overlays
- No messaging fabric in the base demo (Kafka/AMQ come later, when the audience understands *why*)

## Quick start

**Run north locally:**

```bash
cd north/
pip install flask
python app.py
# Stage dashboard:  http://localhost:8080/stage
# Send test event:  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ingest \
#                     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
#                     -d '{"event":"tap","device":"test"}'
```

**Deploy to OpenShift:**

```bash
oc kustomize deploy/overlays/qa/ | oc apply -f -
```

## What is running today

| Component | Description | Platform |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **north** | Flask event aggregator + SSE + stage dashboard | ROSA (AWS) |
| **south-ui** | Browser UI for participants to generate events | ROSA (AWS) |
| **stage dashboard** | Operator-only live view with sound (not public) | Served by north |

## Design principles

- Prefer **simple, readable components** over clever ones
- Make boundaries explicit
- Avoid premature abstraction
- Optimize for **human understanding**, not system density
