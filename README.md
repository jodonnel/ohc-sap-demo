# Open Hybrid Cloud Demo for SAP

This repository contains a **live, replayable Open Hybrid Cloud (OHC) demonstration** focused on SAP workloads and event-driven architectures.  
It is designed for **in-room, human-facing demos** where real actions at the edge are immediately visible on an enterprise platform.

The emphasis is on **clarity, continuity, and credibility** — not simulation, not slideware.

---

## What this demo shows

At a high level, this demo illustrates how:

- Real events generated by people or devices at the **edge**
- Flow through a lightweight **southbound interface**
- Are processed on **Red Hat OpenShift**
- And become immediately visible to **IT / decision-support systems**

Once this boundary works, everything north of it becomes a **design choice**, not a leap of faith.

This is the core Open Hybrid Cloud idea made tangible.

## Architecture (conceptual)

```
[ Humans / Devices ]
        |
        v
   South UI (Edge)
        |
        v
---------------------  ← Intentional boundary
        |
        v
   North Service (IT)
        |
        v
   State / Insight
```

Key characteristics:

- **Event-driven** (no polling from the edge into IT)
- **Observable and auditable**
- **Reproducible** across clusters
- **Pause / resume capable** without losing state

There is intentionally **no messaging fabric** (Kafka, AMQ, etc.) in the base demo.  
Those come later, when the audience understands *why* they matter.

---

## What is running today

Authoritative environment: **ROSA (AWS)**

- `north`  
  Lightweight Python service that ingests events and exposes state

- `south-ui`  
  Browser-based UI used by participants to generate real events

- `north stage dashboard`  
  Operator-only view used on the **stage screen only**  
  Not exposed to participants and not discoverable

---

## What this repository is (and is not)

### This repository **is**:

- A **reference demo**, not a product
- Designed to be **understood live**, in a room
- Structured for **incremental evolution**
- Safe to replay, reset, and explain

### This repository is **not**:

- A production blueprint
- A microservices showcase
- A benchmark
- A marketing microsite

Clarity beats completeness.

## Products and platforms referenced

This demo commonly references (but is not limited to):

- **Red Hat OpenShift**
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**
- **SAP workloads** (application, integration, analytics)
- **Public cloud infrastructure** (ROSA, ARO)

Product names are used descriptively; this repository is independently owned and maintained.

---

## How this demo is typically used

- Live presentation or workshop
- QR-driven or browser-driven interaction
- Audience participation from personal devices
- Presenter monitors system state via a **private stage screen**

The demo works best when people can say:

> “That one was me.”

That moment is the hook.

---

## Design principles

- Prefer **simple, readable components** over clever ones
- Make boundaries explicit
- Avoid premature abstraction
- Preserve state unless there is a reason not to
- Optimize for **human understanding**, not system density

---

## Status

Active and evolving.

Future iterations may introduce:

- Policy enforcement at the boundary
- Identity-aware routing
- AI-assisted interpretation of events
- Integration with SAP Business Technology Platform

All additions should preserve the core clarity of the demo.

---

## Ownership

This repository is maintained by its author for demonstration and educational purposes.

It intentionally avoids top-level branding while remaining compatible with  
Red Hat and SAP platform narratives.

*If you are looking for a demo that tells the truth — this is.*
